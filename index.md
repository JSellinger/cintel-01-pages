# Look Mom! Baby's First Website (I'm Baby) 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links (Two hashes is a second level heading)

Here's a clickable link: [My favorite AI assistant](www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-sellinger) Its me - I'm my favorite AI assistant

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
